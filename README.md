 Remember, the aria-* attributes are an exception to the rule that all
  JSX properties and attributes use camelCase. In the case of ARIA attributes, 
  it's proper JSX syntax to use the hyphen-cased syntax, just like in plain HTML.

Step 1:  Improving the semantic markup you're using

Improve your app accessibility by improving the semantic markup youâ€™re using.

Note: This step's completion will depend on how much work you've already done on making your app's code semantic in the previous lesson items that were dedicated to this specific goal.
Step 2: Use ARIA attributes

Improve app accessibility by using ARIA attributes

Add at least the aria-label attribute and set it to On Click, as follows:

aria-label="On Click"

Tip: Remember, the aria-* attributes are an exception to the rule that all JSX properties and attributes use camelCase. In the case of ARIA attributes, it's proper JSX syntax to use the hyphen-cased syntax, just like in plain HTML.

Note: This step's completion will also depend on how much attention you've paid to the semantic structure of your app in the previous exercises.
Step 3: Labeling forms

To improve the accessibility of your forms, use the label element and the HTML For attribute, which maps to the id attribute of the actual form item, such as an input.

Note: This is important because it allows users to click on a specific form input label, and it will automatically focus into the given form input.
